Dictionary with Trie Data Structure

This project implements a dictionary using the trie data structure. The dictionary allows efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations for words.

Features
- Efficient storage of words using the trie data structure.
- Support for insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- File input/output operations for loading words from a text file.
- Simple and intuitive interface for dictionary operations.

Files
The project consists of the following files:
1. Trie_node.h: Header file containing declarations for trie node structure and related functions.
2. Trie_node.c: Source file containing definitions for functions declared in Trie_node.h.
3. Trie_operations.h: Header file containing declarations for trie operations such as insertion, deletion, search, etc.
4. Trie_operations.c: Source file containing definitions for functions declared in Trie_operations.h.
5. Dictionary.h: Header file containing declarations for dictionary operations.
6. Dictionary.c: Source file containing definitions for functions declared in Dictionary.h.
7. File_io.h: Header file containing declarations for file input/output operations.
8. File_io.c: Source file containing definitions for functions related to file input/output operations.
9. Word.txt: Text file used to check the functionality of file_io.h.

Usage
To use the dictionary:
- Compile the source files along with the main file.
- Run the compiled executable.
- Use the dictionary interface to perform insertion, deletion, and search operations on words.
- Optionally, load words from a text file using the file input/output operations.

Dependencies
- The project has no external dependencies apart from the standard C library.

Support
- For any issues or questions regarding the project, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
