Dictionary with Trie Data Structure
This project implements a dictionary using the trie data structure. The dictionary allows efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations for words.

Features
Efficient storage of words using the trie data structure.
Support for insertion, deletion, and search operations.
File input/output operations for loading words from a text file.
Simple and intuitive interface for dictionary operations.
Files
The project consists of the following files:

Trie_node.h: Header file containing declarations for trie node structure and related functions.
Trie_node.c: Source file containing definitions for functions declared in Trie_node.h.
Trie_operations.h: Header file containing declarations for trie operations such as insertion, deletion, search, etc.
Trie_operations.c: Source file containing definitions for functions declared in Trie_operations.h.
Dictionary.h: Header file containing declarations for dictionary operations.
Dictionary.c: Source file containing definitions for functions declared in Dictionary.h.
File_io.h: Header file containing declarations for file input/output operations.
File_io.c: Source file containing definitions for functions related to file input/output operations.
Word.txt: Text file used to check the functionality of file_io.h.
Usage
To use the dictionary:

Compile the source files along with the main file.
Run the compiled executable.
Use the dictionary interface to perform insertion, deletion, and search operations on words.
Optionally, load words from a text file using the file input/output operations.
Dependencies
The project has no external dependencies apart from the standard C library.
